# If

Go's if statements are like its for loops; the expression need not be surrounded by parentheses ( ) but the braces { } are required.

## If with a short statement

Like for, the if statement can start with a short statement to execute before the condition.

Variables declared by the statement are only in scope until the end of the if.

(Try using v in the last return statement.)

## If and else

Variables declared inside an if short statement are also available inside any of the else blocks.
